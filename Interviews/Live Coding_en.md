1. Write function for most occurent word in word document

string document, int n - args 

Example
foo foo bar

N = 0 -> foo
N = 1 -> bar


2. Given an integer array, find the maximum length subarray having a given sum.
For example, consider the following array:
nums[] = { 5, 6, -5, 5, 3, 5, 3, -2, 0 }
target = 8
 
 
Subarrays with sum 8 are
 
{ -5, 5, 3, 5 }
{ 3, 5 }
{ 5, 3 }
 
The longest subarray is { -5, 5, 3, 5 } having length 4

3. In-place merge two sorted arrays
Given two sorted arrays, X[] and Y[] of size m and n each, merge elements of X[] with elements of array Y[] by maintaining the sorted order, i.e., 
fill X[] with the first m smallest elements and fill Y[] with remaining elements.
Do the conversion in-place and without using any other data structure.
 
For example,
Input:
 
X[] = { 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 }
Y[] = { 2, 3, 9 }
 
Output:
 
X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 }
Y[] = { 8, 9, 10 }

4. Prove that the tree is a binary search tree
